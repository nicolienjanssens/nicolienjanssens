title: "Ranking Proposals on Online Deliberative Platforms: a Critical Review"
collection: publications
category: wip
permalink: 'ranking-proposals-on-online-deliberative-platforms'
excerpt: 'This manuscript focuses on ranking methods for DDPs, i.e., the way plat-
forms order proposals in a list when showing them to users. We distinguish
three ranking goals: voting, offline deliberation and online deliberation.
We concentrate on ranking for online deliberation. Our contribution is
threefold. First, we argue that a principled approach to ranking is nec-
essary, in light of the democratic objectives of DDPs. Second, inspecting
a representative sample of DDPs that are used in practice, we observe
that the choice for a ranking method is often ad hoc. Third, we intro-
duce three principles for the selection of ranking methods, and argue that
one of them, namely maximising approval diversity, should be emphasised
in ranking for online deliberation. We thus obtain a conceptual toolbox
for platform designers, hosts and users to make and justify choices for a
ranking method.'

This manuscript focuses on ranking methods for DDPs, i.e., the way plat-
forms order proposals in a list when showing them to users. We distinguish
three ranking goals: voting, offline deliberation and online deliberation.
We concentrate on ranking for online deliberation. Our contribution is
threefold. First, we argue that a principled approach to ranking is nec-
essary, in light of the democratic objectives of DDPs. Second, inspecting
a representative sample of DDPs that are used in practice, we observe
that the choice for a ranking method is often ad hoc. Third, we intro-
duce three principles for the selection of ranking methods, and argue that
one of them, namely maximising approval diversity, should be emphasised
in ranking for online deliberation. We thus obtain a conceptual toolbox
for platform designers, hosts and users to make and justify choices for a
